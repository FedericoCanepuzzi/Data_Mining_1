## Introduction

This project, based on a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists, is focus on uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’.

## Tasks

- **Data Understanding**: Explore the dataset with the analytical tools studied and write a concise “data understanding” report describing data semantics, assessing data quality, the distribution of the variables and the pairwise correlations.

- **Association Rules**: Explore the dataset using frequent pattern mining and association rules extraction. Then use them to predict a variable either for replacing missing values or to predict target variable.
